*Project Overview: Password Management System*

This project involves creating a password management system using HTML and CSS for the frontend, Flask (a web framework in Python) for the backend, and SQL for the database. 
We will provide a login page with fields for username and password, leading to a menu with options to add and get passwords. If the password or username is incorrect invalid 
message will be displayed.Users will be prompted to provide their username, website address, and password if they choose to add a password. If the user selects the option 
to get a password, they will be asked for the website address to display the password. If the password is incorrect or the website is not found, an appropriate message will 
be displayed.We use Flask-MySQL and Python to connect to a database, storing website addresses, usernames, and passwords. We prioritize user security and privacy throughout 
the development process.
Here's a description of the password manager website:
